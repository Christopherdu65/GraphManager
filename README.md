Program that maintains a network of towns and the roads connecting them.

It also uses Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path algorithm to find the shortest distance between any two towns.

Most methods are tested through JUnit.

The data structure used will be a graph that will be implemented using a GraphInterface.

The data manager will hold any object of the graph, and it will be implemented using TownGraphManagerInterface.
